# A configuration fragment for Tom Short’s Dactyl-ManuForm, ca. v0.4.

# The long-term goal with this file is to have it produce Short’s design
# through the DMOTE application for upstream compatibility.

# As of DMOTE v0.4.0, that is not yet possible, because:
# - No internal shelf for the MCU.
# - No USB A.
# - No wire hooks.
# - Incomplete support for switch mounting plates other than 1 u.
# - Bottom plating does not project from screw anchors.
