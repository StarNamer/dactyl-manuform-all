# The Dactyl Keyboard
The Dactyl is a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

This fork is an experiment in changing the mounting style of the dactyl. Originally designed as a tray-mount keyboard, this version creates a bottom-mount dactyl variant. 

* [This guide from Thomas Baart can tell you more about keyboard mounting styles.](https://thomasbaart.nl/2019/04/07/cheat-sheet-custom-keyboard-mounting-styles/)

Other changes include:

* reversion to 1u outer keys from 1.5u keys.
* widened bezels to accommodate mounting hardware.
* increased column stagger to accommodate my own hands. 
* separation of top plate from top case.

## Assembly

### Generating a Design

**Setting up the Clojure environment**
* [Install the Clojure runtime](https://clojure.org)
* [Install the Leiningen project manager](http://leiningen.org/)
* [Install OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

**Generating the design**
* Run `lein repl`
* Load the file `(load-file "src/dactyl_keyboard/dactyl.clj")`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files

**Tips**
* [Some other ways to evaluate the clojure design file](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28213489)
* [Example designing with clojure](http://adereth.github.io/blog/2014/04/09/3d-printing-with-clojure/)


### Printing
Pregenerated STL files are available in the [things/](things/) directory.

### Wiring
Masks for the flexible PCBs I used are available for the [left](resources/pcb-left.svg) and [right](resources/pcb-right.svg) side.

A [very rough guide for the brave is here](guide/README.org#wiring) - It will be improved over time (**TODO**)!
