# The Dactyl Keyboard (Arduino Edition)

This is based on [Matthew Adereth's original Dactyl Keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard). However, I delete everything under AGPL license, and only remain the file under [things](things) folder.

I change the micro-controller from Teensy 2.0 to Arduino, which is easier to obtain. Instead of single controller, I use two Arduino, each side has one, so they can work independently if necessary.
