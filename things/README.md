## 3D Print File for Dactyl Keyboard

This folder contains the 3d print file for Dactyl keyboard. `.scad` file is the source file of model, and `.stl` file is used for 3d printing.

I modified original design so that both left-side and right-side can contain a micro-controller. (I basically mirror all of the right-side design to left side).
